## Hello There Everyone
Here I have made a Space Invader Arcade Game using Python

To run the game :
* Clone the repository
* Go to the directory `cd ../HackPython-21/Python Games/Space Invader Game`
* Then run the `main.py` using Python.... like `python main.py`


# How the game works? 

The objective is to shoot as many invaders before they reach you.

1. You start the game.
2. You can move your character left or right using the left and right arrows on your keyboard.

3. You can shoot a missile towards the Invaders by clicking the spacebar.

4. When a invader reaches you the game ends.
